## Executive Summary

California aims to achieve a fully zero-emission transportation system by 2035. As electric vehicle (EV) adoption accelerates, the state faces growing pressure to expand its charging infrastructure equitably and efficiently. This project evaluates California’s readiness to meet future EV charging demand by analyzing spatial disparities between EV registrations, population density, and charger distribution.

The analysis reveals regions where EV infrastructure remains underdeveloped and at risk of overloading due to rapid EV adoption. It also identifies potential business opportunities for private and public investment in underserved areas. The findings suggest that targeted funding allocation can help balance regional disparities and ensure California’s successful transition toward an emission-free transportation future.

## Project Proposal and Data Source

This project investigates geographic and economic imbalances in California’s EV charging network. By comparing the distribution of charging stations with EV registration data and regional population density, it identifies areas where infrastructure development lags behind EV growth. The project also integrates future EV sales forecasts to anticipate charger demand and guide data-driven decision-making for both policymakers and investors.

**Data Sources:**

	•	EV Charging Infrastructure data from the U.S. Department of Transportation
  
	•	Population data by ZIP code from the U.S. Census Bureau
  
	•	Vehicle fuel type data by ZIP code from the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA)
  
	•	ZIP code geolocation data from the U.S. Postal Service

## Introduction and Motivation

California currently has over 150,000 public and private chargers installed statewide and continues to lead the nation in zero-emission transportation initiatives. The state is projected to receive over $380 million from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and more than $1 billion in total for EV and hydrogen refueling infrastructure.

Despite this progress, the surge in EV ownership presents new challenges for infrastructure readiness, particularly in regions with limited charger density. As the EV supply equipment (EVSE) industry is projected to reach $100 billion in market value by 2040, ensuring an equitable and efficient distribution of charging resources is critical.

The motivation for this project is to:

	•	Evaluate the adequacy of California’s existing EV infrastructure.
  
	•	Identify spatial and investment gaps in charger accessibility.
  
	•	Forecast future EV and charging demand to assess statewide readiness.

By integrating demographic, spatial, and infrastructure data, this analysis provides insights into California’s ability to meet its 2035 zero-emission goals while identifying regions with high potential for infrastructure growth.
